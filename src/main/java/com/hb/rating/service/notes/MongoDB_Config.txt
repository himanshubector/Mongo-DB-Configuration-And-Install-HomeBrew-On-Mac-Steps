—————————————


The mongo command line tool is a client application that allows you to interact with a running MongoDB server. Here are the basic steps to use the mongo command line tool:

1. Make sure that MongoDB is running on your system. You can check if MongoDB is running by typing the command mongod in a command prompt or terminal window.

2. Open a new command prompt or terminal window.

3. Type the command mongo and hit enter. This will start the mongo shell and connect to the default MongoDB server running on your local machine. If you want to connect to a different server, you can specify the hostname or IP address of the server as an argument to the mongo command. For example: javascript  mongo mongodb://hostname:port/   
4. Once you are connected to the MongoDB server, you can start entering commands to interact with the server. Here are some examples of commands you can use:

    * show databases - This command will list all the databases available on the server.
    * use dbname - This command will switch to the specified database.
    * show collections - This command will list all the collections in the current database.
    * db.collection_name.find() - This command will return all the documents in the specified collection.
    * db.collection_name.insertOne() - This command will insert a new document into the specified collection.
    * db.collection_name.updateOne() - This command will update an existing document in the specified collection.
    * db.collection_name.deleteOne() - This command will delete an existing document from the specified collection.


5. You can find more information on the available commands in the MongoDB documentation.
6. When you are finished using the mongo shell, you can type the command exit to close the shell and disconnect from the MongoDB server.

To install mongodb-compass, run:
  brew install --cask mongodb-compass



In MongoDB, id's are by default auto-generated

And also we use @Document instead of using @Entity as in case of Jpa Repository
